# OpenGL research

Windows application that uses GLFW and GLAD libraries in order to implement OpenGL. The main purpose of the project is R&D.

## Clone and build

The repo has all dependencies in the deps folder, so it should be possible to clone and launch the application "out of the box". However, it is recommended to build GLAD yourself.
